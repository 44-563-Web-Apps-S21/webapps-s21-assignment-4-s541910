    <h3>The Comedy of Errors</h3>

    <h5>ACT II
        SCENE I. The house of ANTIPHOLUS of Ephesus.--Antipholus of Syracuse goes to the inn and finds that his slave
        did, in fact, bring his money and luggage safely there.</h5>
   <p>
    ADRIANA
    Neither my husband nor the slave return'd,
    That in such haste I sent to seek his master!
    Sure, Luciana, it is two o'clock.
    LUCIANA
    Perhaps some merchant hath invited him,
    And from the mart he's somewhere gone to dinner.
    Good sister, let us dine and never fret:
    A man is master of his liberty:
    Time is their master, and, when they see time,
    They'll go or come: if so, be patient, sister.
    ADRIANA
    Why should their liberty than ours be more?
    LUCIANA
    Because their business still lies out o' door.
    ADRIANA
    Look, when I serve him so, he takes it ill.
    LUCIANA
    O, know he is the bridle of your will.
    ADRIANA
    There's none but asses will be bridled so.
    LUCIANA
    Why, headstrong liberty is lash'd with woe.
    There's nothing situate under heaven's eye
    But hath his bound, in earth, in sea, in sky:
    The beasts, the fishes, and the winged fowls,
    Are their males' subjects and at their controls:
    Men, more divine, the masters of all these,
    Lords of the wide world and wild watery seas,
    Indued with intellectual sense and souls,
    Of more preeminence than fish and fowls,
    Are masters to their females, and their lords:
    Then let your will attend on their accords.
    ADRIANA
    This servitude makes you to keep unwed.
    LUCIANA
    Not this, but troubles of the marriage-bed.
