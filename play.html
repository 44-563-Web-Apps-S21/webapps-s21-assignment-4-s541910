    <h1>Ramu Vallapurapu Presents Shakesphere Play</h1>

    <h2>The Comedy of Errors</h2>

    <h3>ACT II SCENE I <p class="directions">The house of ANTIPHOLUS of Ephesus.</p>
    </h3>

    <p id="direction">Enter ADRIANA and LUCIANA</p>

    <h6 class="charname1">ADRIANA</h6>
    <p class="AdrinaSpeech">
        Neither my husband nor the slave return'd,
        That in such haste I sent to seek his master!
        Sure, Luciana, it is two o'clock.</p>

    <h6 class="charname2">LUCIANA</h6>
    <p class="LucinaSpeech">
        Perhaps some merchant hath invited him,
        And from the mart he's somewhere gone to dinner.
        Good sister, let us dine and never fret:
        A man is master of his liberty:
        Time is their master, and, when they see time,
        They'll go or come: if so, be patient, sister.</p>
    <h6 class="charname1">ADRIANA</h6>
    <p class="AdrinaSpeech">
        Why should their liberty than ours be more?</p>
    <h6 class="charname2"> LUCIANA</h6>
    <p class="LucinaSpeech">
        Because their business still lies out o' door.</p>
    <h6 class="charname1">ADRIANA</h6>
    <p class="AdrinaSpeech">Look, when I serve him so, he takes it ill.</p>
    <h6 class="charname2">LUCIANA</h6>
    <p class="LucinaSpeech">O, know he is the bridle of your will.</p>
    <h6 class="charname1">ADRIANA</h6>
    <p class="AdrinaSpeech"> There's none but asses will be bridled so.</p>
    <h6 class="charname2"> LUCIANA</h6>
    <p class="LucinaSpeech">
        Why, headstrong liberty is lash'd with woe.
        There's nothing situate under heaven's eye
        But hath his bound, in earth, in sea, in sky:
        The beasts, the fishes, and the winged fowls,
        Are their males' subjects and at their controls:
        Men, more divine, the masters of all these,
        Lords of the wide world and wild watery seas,
        Indued with intellectual sense and souls,
        Of more preeminence than fish and fowls,
        Are masters to their females, and their lords:
        Then let your will attend on their accords.</p>
    <h6 class="charname1"> ADRIANA</h6>
    <p class="AdrinaSpeech">This servitude makes you to keep unwed.</p>
    <h6 class="charname2">LUCIANA</h6>
    <p class="LucinaSpeech">Not this, but troubles of the marriage-bed.</p>
    <h6 class="charname3">DROMIO OF EPHESUS</h6>
    <p class="DromioSpeech">Nay, he's at two hands with me, and that my two ears
        can witness.</p>
