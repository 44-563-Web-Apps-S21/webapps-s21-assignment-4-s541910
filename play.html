    <h3>The Comedy of Errors</h3>

    <h5>ACT II
        SCENE I. The house of ANTIPHOLUS of Ephesus.--Antipholus of Syracuse goes to the inn and finds that his slave did, in fact, bring his money and luggage safely there.</h5>
    <p>
        <b>ADRIANA</b>
        Neither my husband nor the slave return'd,
        That in such haste I sent to seek his master!
        Sure, Luciana, it is two o'clock.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b> ADRIANA</b>
        Why should their liberty than ours be more?
    </p>
    <p>
        <b> LUCIANA</b>
        Because their business still lies out o' door.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b> ADRIANA</b>
        Look, when I serve him so, he takes it ill.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b> LUCIANA</b>
        O, know he is the bridle of your will.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b> ADRIANA</b>
        There's none but asses will be bridled so.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>LUCIANA</b>
        Perhaps some merchant hath invited him,
        And from the mart he's somewhere gone to dinner.
        Good sister, let us dine and never fret:
        A man is master of his liberty:
        Time is their master, and, when they see time,
        They'll go or come: if so, be patient, sister.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b> DROMIO OF EPHESUS</b>
        Nay, he's at two hands with me, and that my two ears
        can witness.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>DROMIO OF EPHESUS</b>
        Ay, ay, he told his mind upon mine ear:
        Beshrew his hand, I scarce could understand it.
    </p>
